Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There's a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that youâ€™d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. This tutorial teaches you to build a support for your data source.

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Build a data source to visualize a sine wave
- Construct queries using the query editor
- Configure your data source using the config editor

### Prerequisites

- Grafana 7.0
- NodeJS 12.x
- yarn

A data source in Grafana must extend the `DataSourceApi` interface, which requires you to defines two methods: `query` and `testDatasource`.

### The `query` method

The `query` method is the heart of any data source plugin. It accepts a query from the user, retrieves the data from an external database, and returns the data in a format that Grafana recognizes.

```
async query(options: DataQueryRequest<MyQuery>): Promise<DataQueryResponse>
```

The `options` object contains the queries, or _targets_, that the user made, along with context information, like the current time interval. Use this information to query an external database.

> The term _target_ originates from Graphite, and the earlier days of Grafana when Graphite was the only supported data source. As Grafana gained support for more data sources, the term "target" became synonymous with any type of query.

### Test your data source

`testDatasource` implements a health check for your data source. For example, Grafana calls this method whenever the user clicks the **Save & Test** button, after changing the connection settings.

```
async testDatasource()
```

{{< tutorials/step title="Data frames" >}}

Nowadays there are countless of different databases, each with their own ways of querying data. To be able to support all the different data formats, Grafana consolidates the data into a unified data structure called _data frames_.

Let's see how to create and return a data frame from the `query` method. In this step, you'll change the code in the starter plugin to return a [sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave).

1. In the current `query` method, remove the code inside the `map` function.

   The `query` method now look like this:

   ```ts
   async query(options: DataQueryRequest<MyQuery>): Promise<DataQueryResponse> {
     const { range } = options;
     const from = range!.from.valueOf();
     const to = range!.to.valueOf();

     const data = options.targets.map(target => {
       // Your code goes here.
     });

     return { data };
   }
   ```

1. In the `map` function, use the `lodash/defaults` package to set default values for query properties that haven't been set:

   ```ts
   const query = defaults(target, defaultQuery);
   ```

1. Create a data frame with a time field and a number field:

   ```ts
   const frame = new MutableDataFrame({
     refId: query.refId,
     fields: [
       { name: 'time', type: FieldType.time },
       { name: 'value', type: FieldType.number },
     ],
   });
   ```

   `refId` needs to be set to tell Grafana which query that generated this date frame.

Next, we'll add the actual values to the data frame. Don't worry about the math used to calculate the values.

1. Create a couple of helper variables:

   ```ts
   // duration of the time range, in milliseconds.
   const duration = to - from;

   // step determines how close in time (ms) the points will be to each other.
   const step = duration / 1000;
   ```

1. Add the values to the data frame:

   ```ts
   for (let t = 0; t < duration; t += step) {
     frame.add({ time: from + t, value: Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * t) / duration) });
   }
   ```

   The `frame.add()` accepts an object where the keys corresponds to the name of each field in the data frame.

1. Return the data frame:

   ```ts
   return frame;
   ```

1. Rebuild the plugin and try it out.

Your data source is now sending data frames that Grafana can visualize. Next, we'll look at how you can control the frequency of the sine wave by defining a _query_.

> In this example, we're generating timestamps from the current time range. This means that you'll get the same graph no matter what time range you're using. In practice, you'd instead use the timestamps returned by your database.

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Define a query" >}}

Most data sources offer a way to query specific data. MySQL and PostgreSQL use SQL, while Prometheus has its own query language, called _PromQL_. No matter what query language your databases are using, Grafana lets you build support for it.

Add support for custom queries to your data source, by implementing a your own _query editor_, a React component that enables users to build their own queries, through a user-friendly graphical interface.

A query editor can be as simple as a text field where the user edits the raw query text, or it can provide a more user-friendly form with drop-down menus and switches, that later gets converted into the raw query text before it gets sent off to the database.

### Define the query model

The first step in designing your query editor is to define its _query model_. The query model defines the user input to your data source.

We want to be able to control the frequency of the sine wave, so let's add another property.

1. Add a new number property called `frequency` to the query model:

   **src/types.ts**

   ```ts
   export interface MyQuery extends DataQuery {
     queryText?: string;
     constant: number;
     frequency: number;
   }
   ```

1. Set a default value to the new `frequency` property:

   ```ts
   export const defaultQuery: Partial<MyQuery> = {
     constant: 6.5,
     frequency: 1.0,
   };
   ```

### Bind the model to a form

Now that you've defined the query model you wish to support, the next step is to bind the model to a form. The `FormField` is a text field component from `grafana/ui` that lets you register a listener which will be invoked whenever the form field value changes.

1. Add a new form field to the query editor to control the new frequency property.

   **QueryEditor.tsx**

   ```ts
   const { queryText, constant, frequency } = query;
   ```

   ```ts
   <FormField
     width={4}
     value={frequency}
     onChange={this.onFrequencyChange}
     label="Frequency"
     type="number"
   />
   ```

1. Add a event listener for the new property.

   ```ts
   onFrequencyChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const { onChange, query, onRunQuery } = this.props;
     onChange({ ...query, frequency: parseFloat(event.target.value) });
     // executes the query
     onRunQuery();
   };
   ```

   The registered listener, `onFrequencyChange`, calls `onChange` to update the current query with the value from the form field.

   `onRunQuery();` tells Grafana to run the query after each change. For fast queries, this is recommended to provide a more responsive experience.

### Use the property

The new query model is now ready to use in our `query` method.

1. In the `query` method, use the `frequency` property to adjust our equation.

   ```ts
   frame.add({ time: from + t, value: Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * query.frequency * t) / duration) });
   ```

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Configure your data source" >}}

To access a specific data source, you often need to configure things like hostname, credentials, or authentication method. A _config editor_ lets your users configure your data source plugin to fit their needs.

The config editor looks similar to the query editor, in that it defines a model and binds it to a form.

Since we're not actually connecting to an external database in our sine wave example, we don't really need many options. To show you how you can add an option however, we're going to add the _wave resolution_ as an option.

The resolution controls how close in time the data points are to each other. A higher resolution means more points closer together, at the cost of more data being processed.

### Define the options model

1. Add a new number property called `resolution` to the options model.

   **types.ts**

   ```ts
   export interface MyDataSourceOptions extends DataSourceJsonData {
     path?: string;
     resolution?: number;
   }
   ```

### Bind the model to a form

Just like query editor, the form field in the config editor calls the registered listener whenever the value changes.

1. Add a new form field to the query editor to control the new resolution option.

   **ConfigEditor.tsx**

   ```ts
   <div className="gf-form">
     <FormField
       label="Resolution"
       onChange={this.onResolutionChange}
       value={jsonData.resolution || ''}
       placeholder="Enter a number"
     />
   </div>
   ```

1. Add a event listener for the new option.

   ```ts
   onResolutionChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const { onOptionsChange, options } = this.props;
     const jsonData = {
       ...options.jsonData,
       resolution: parseFloat(event.target.value),
     };
     onOptionsChange({ ...options, jsonData });
   };
   ```

   The `onResolutionChange` listener calls `onOptionsChange` to update the current options with the value from the form field.

### Use the option

1. Create a property called `resolution` to the `DataSource` class.

   ```ts
   export class DataSource extends DataSourceApi<MyQuery, MyDataSourceOptions> {
     resolution: number;

     constructor(instanceSettings: DataSourceInstanceSettings<MyDataSourceOptions>) {
       super(instanceSettings);

       this.resolution = instanceSettings.jsonData.resolution || 1000.0;
     }

     // ...
   ```

1. In the `query` method, use the `resolution` property to calculate the step size.

   **src/DataSource.ts**

   ```ts
   const step = duration / this.resolution;
   ```

{{< tutorials/step title="Get data from an external API" >}}

So far, you've generated the data returned by the data source. A more realistic use case would be to fetch data from an external API.

While you can use something like [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) or the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make requests, we recommend using the [`getBackendSrv`](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/packages_api/runtime/getbackendsrv/) function from the [grafana/runtime](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/packages_api/runtime/) package.

The main advantage of `getBackendSrv` is that it proxies requests through the Grafana server rather making the request from the browser. This is strongly recommended when making authenticated requests to an external API. For more information on authenticating external requests, refer to [Add authentication for data source plugins].

1. Import `getBackendSrv`.

   **src/DataSource.ts**

   ```ts
   import { getBackendSrv } from "@grafana/runtime"
   ```

1. Create a helper method `doRequest` and use the `datasourceRequest` method to make a request to your API. Replace `https://api.example.com/metrics` to point to your own API endpoint.

   ```ts
   async doRequest(query: MyQuery) {
     const result = await getBackendSrv().datasourceRequest({
       method: "GET",
       url: "https://api.example.com/metrics",
       params: query,
     })

     return result;
   }
   ```

1. Make a request for each query. `Promises.all` waits for all requests to finish before returning the data.

   ```ts
   async query(options: DataQueryRequest<MyQuery>): Promise<DataQueryResponse> {
     const promises = options.targets.map((query) =>
       this.doRequest(query).then((response) => {
         const frame = new MutableDataFrame({
           refId: query.refId,
           fields: [
             { name: "Time", type: FieldType.time },
             { name: "Value", type: FieldType.number },
           ],
         });

         response.data.forEach((point: any) => {
           frame.appendRow([point.time, point.value]);
         });

         return frame;
       })
     );

     return Promise.all(promises).then((data) => ({ data }));
   }
   ```
