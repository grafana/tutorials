{{< tutorials/step title="Introduction" >}}

This tutorial is useful for admins and others who want to learn how to manage users. In this tutorial, you'll add multiple users, organize them into teams, and make sure they're only able to access the resources they need.

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Add users.
- Assign users to teams.
- Manage dashboard access using folders.
- Override access for individual dashboards.

### Scenario

_Grafana_, a fictional telemarketing company, has asked you to configure Grafana for their teams.

In this scenario, you'll:

- Create users and organize them into teams.
- Manage resource access for each user and team through roles and folders.

### Prerequisites

- Grafana 7.0

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Add users" >}}

In Grafana, all users are granted an _organization role_ that determines what resources they can access.

There are three types of organization roles in Grafana:

- **Admin -** For managing data sources, teams, and users within an organization.
- **Editor -** For creating and editing dashboards.
- **Viewer -** For viewing dashboards.


> **Note**: You can also configure Grafana to allow [anonymous access](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/#anonymous-authentication), to make dashboards available even to those who don't have a Grafana user account. That's how Grafana Labs made https://play.grafana.com publicly available.

### Exercise

Grafana has asked you to add a group of early adopters.

| Name              | Email                     | Username          |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Almaz Russom      | almaz.russom@example.com  | almaz.russom      |
| Brenda Tilman     | brenda.tilman@example.com | brenda.tilman     |
| Mada Rawdha Tahan | mada.rawdha.tahan@example | mada.rawdha.tahan |
| Yuan Yang         | yuan.yang@example.com     | yuan.yang         |

#### Add a user

Repeat the following steps for each of the employees.

1. On the sidebar, click the **Server Admin** (shield) icon.
1. In the Users tab, click **New user**.
1. In **Name**, enter the name of the user.
1. In **E-mail**, enter the email of the user.
1. In **Username**, enter the username that the user will use to log in.
1. In **Password**, enter a password. The user can change their password once they log in.
1. Click **Create** to create the user account.

When you create a user, they're granted the Viewer role, which means that they won't be able to make any changes to any of the resources in Grafana. That's ok for now, though. In the next step, you'll grant some users more permissions by adding them to _teams_.

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Assign users to teams" >}}

Instead of granting permissions to individual users, teams let you grant permissions to a group of users.

Teams are useful when onboarding new colleagues. If you add a user to a team, they get access to all resources assigned to that team.

### Exercise

In this exercise, you'll assign users to their corresponding team.

| Username          | Team        |
|-------------------|-------------|
| brenda.tilman     | Marketing   |
| mada.rawdha.tahan | Marketing   |
| almaz.russom      | Engineering |
| yuan.yang         | Engineering |

You'll create a team, then add users to it. You'll then repeat the process with the second team and the remaining users.

#### Create a team

1. In the sidebar, hover your mouse over the **Configuration** (gear) icon and then click **Teams**.
1. Click **New team**.
1. In **Name**, enter the name of the team: either _Marketing_ or _Engineering_. You do not need to enter an email.
1. Click **Create**.

#### Add a user to a team

1. Click **Add member**.
1. In the **Add team member** box, select the user you want to add to the team. Refer to the table above for team assignments.
1. Click **Add to team**.

When you're done, you'll have two teams with two users assigned to each.

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Manage resource access with folders" >}}

Use folders to organize collections of related dashboards.

### Exercise

The Marketing team is going to use Grafana for analytics, while the Engineering team wants to monitor the application they're building.

You'll create two folders, _Analytics_ and _Application_, where each team can add their own dashboards. The teams still want to be able to view each other's dashboards.

| Folder      | Team        | Permissions |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Analytics   | Marketing   | Edit        |
|             | Engineering | View        |
| Application | Marketing   | View        |
|             | Engineering | Edit        |

Repeat the following steps for each folder.

#### Add a folder for each team

1. In the sidebar, hover your cursor over the **Dashboards** (four squares) icon and then click **Manage**.
1. To create a folder, click **New Folder**.
1. In **Name**, enter the folder name.
1. Click **Create**.

#### Remove Viewer role from folder permissions

By default, when you create a folder, all users with the Viewer role are granted permission to view the folder.

In this example, Grafana wants to explicitly grant teams access to folders. To support this, you need to remove the Viewer role from the list of permissions:

1. In the sidebar, hover your cursor over the **Dashboards** (four squares) icon and then click **Manage**.
1. Hover your cursor over the folder name, and click the cog icon to the right.
1. Go to the **Permissions** tab.
1. Remove the Viewer role from the list, by clicking the red button on the right.

#### Grant folder permissions to a team:

1. Go to the **Permissions** tab, and then click **Add Permission**.
1. In the **Add Permission For** dialog, make sure "Team" is selected in the first box.
1. In the second box, select the team to grant access to.
1. In the third box, select the access you want to grant.
1. Click **Save**.

When you're finished, you'll have two empty folders, the contents of which can only be viewed by members of the Marketing or Engineering teams. Only Marketing team members can edit the contents of the Analytics folder, only Engineering team members can edit the contents of the Application folder.

{{< /tutorials/step >}}
{{< tutorials/step title="Define granular permissions" >}}

By using folders and teams, you avoid having to manage permissions for individual users.

However, there are times when you need to configure permissions on a more granular level. For these cases, Grafana allows you to override permissions for specific dashboards.

### Exercise

Grafana has hired a consultant to assist the Marketing team. The consultant should only be able to access the SEO dashboard in the Analytics folder.

| Name       | Email                            | Username   |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Luc Masson | luc.masson@exampleconsulting.com | luc.masson |

#### Add a new user

1. In the sidebar, click the **Server Admin** (shield) icon.
1. In the Users tab, click **New user**.
1. In **Name**, enter the name of the user.
1. In **E-mail**, enter the email of the user.
1. In **Username**, enter the username that the user will use to log in.
1. In **Password**, enter a password. The user can change their password once they log in.
1. Click **Create user** to create the user account.

#### Create a dashboard

1. In the sidebar, click the **Create** (plus) icon to create a new dashboard.
1. In the top right corner, click the cog icon to go to **Dashboard settings**.
1. In **Name**, enter **SEO**.
1. In the **Folder** list, select **Analytics**.
1. Click the **Go back** arrow and then click the **Save dashboard** (disk) icon.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Grant a user permission to view dashboard

1. In the top right corner of your dashboard, click the cog icon to go to **Dashboard settings**.
1. Go to the **Permissions** tab, and click **Add Permission**.
1. In the **Add Permission For** dialog, select **User** in the first box.
1. In the second box, select the user to grant access to: Luc Masson.
1. In the third box, select **View**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Save dashboard**.
1. Add a note about giving Luc Masson Viewer permission for the dashboard and then click **Save**.

You've created a new user and given them unique permissions to view contents of a folder.
